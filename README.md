# Comparator-VHDL

The objective of this Lab work is to describe a digital Comparator (1-bit and 2-bits) circuit using VHDL in Xilinx ISE (Integrated Software Environment). I also examined the two possible approaches of describing 2-bits comparators in VHDL. The functional simulation to verify the correctness of the comparators description was done. Furthermore, the comparator description was also implemented on the Nexys 4 FPGA board for physical testing.
